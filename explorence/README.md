# Explorence

The vision of Explorence was to "bring the video game outside". At this moment in time, GPS-based apps were getting a lot of attention from the press and investors. I had been tinkering with Android for about a year, and then started helping out Explorence late 2010. In early 2011, I was invited to join as co-founder. 

We started on Android early on (2011) because we believed it was gonna breakout. We shifted to iOS due to simple forces: Android was still way behind iOS technology wise, more importantly, iOS owned the mobile startup realm at this moment in time.

### Dash 2010 (Android)

Dash on Android was the starting point for our GPS-based games. It was the first iteration of the Dash series of titles and can be seen here: [DASH demo with the Scobelizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-mdcn_YM6U) If the UI looks bad, it's because I made it and we didn't have a designer yet :) Also, most Android apps looked bad compared to iOS apps at this time.

A core feature was using GPS To get the GPS based tracking off the ground, we used the open source Android app called [MyTracks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyTracks). The GPS data was stored in the GPX format locally on the Android device, and then shared to our server.

 A new iteration of DASH and had much better UI due bringing on an artist. (Screenshots).
